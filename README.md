For this project, the HTML aspect of it was the simplest part about it. A straightforward h1 tag with the other ones being there for the added tasks.

For my css, I also kept it as simple as I could. Centered and a color scheme that's easy to follow and not to hard on the eyes.

For the Javascript part, I was honestly learning as I went. I wanted to smoothly add the edit funtion but was unsuccesful. What I was able to do was to add and delete tasks. Creating different functinos with if statements.

My biggest errors were getting to add and smoothly make the edit buttons work with css and everything. For the sake of time, I completely erased that and kept what I could.
